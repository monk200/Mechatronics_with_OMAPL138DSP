1.  First create a new folder for your project.
2.  Copy the three files UART.h, UARTFuncs.c and user_newproject.c to the new folder.  These 3 files are in the manualProject.zip file.
3.  In the new folder rename user_newproject.c to any name that you wish ie.  user_DanHW1.c
4.  Now go to CCS 5.1 and open up a new or existing Workspace.  
5.  Select Project->New CCS Project    In the CCS Project window do the following:
	i.	Decide on a project name, i.e. HW1Ex1
	ii.	Output type "Executable"
	iii.	Uncheck Use Default location and Browse for the folder where you copied the files in step 2.
	iv.	In that folder create a New Folder to locate your project, i.e. HW1project, and make that the location for the project.
	v.	Family:  MSP430
	vi.	Variant:  MSP430Gxxx Family and MSP430G2553
	vii.	Connection:  TI MSP430 USB1 (Default)
	viii.	Finally select Empty Project and then click Finish
6.  A simple main.c file is created for you but we will not use it.  In the CCS Project Explorer, explore your new project and right click on main.c and select Delete
7.  Now add the two source files:  Right click on your new project and select Add Files..... 
	i.	Find UARTFuncs.c and your user_<yourname>.c file  select both using the Ctrl key while clicking and then click Open
	ii.	A File Operation Dialog will pop up and I suggest you select Link to files and check Create link locations relative to: PROJECT_LOC  Then OK
8.  Now you should be able to Build and Debug your Project.	
9.  One other thing you may want to do is change the default setting for the use of printf from minimal to full.  
    This will allow you to print floats and longs.  
	i.	Right click on your project and select Properties.
	ii.	Then go to Build->MSP430 Compiler->Advanced Options->Library Function Assumptions
	iii.	Here change Level of printf suppot required to full
